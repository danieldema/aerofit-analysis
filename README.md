In this project, I used SQL (through PostgreSQL) to analyze data for Aerofit treadmill sales. I analyzed preferences of different products based on customer characteristics available in the dataset. I used Excel to create contingency tables based on this analysis, and then used Matplotlib to visualize the contingency tables.

The source of the data is: https://github.com/J-Data-Guy/Aerofit_Project/tree/main
